# BioQuest
BioQuest is a learning program where each quarter’s Biology topics are turned into interactive quizzes. Students can choose different types of quizzes—multiple choice, identification, True or False, and modified True or False—with different difficulties, and even choose which tutor version they want to learn with. The program also records daily quiz results and tracks milestones.
